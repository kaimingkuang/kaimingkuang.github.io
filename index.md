## Biography
I am an algorithm engineer in Xiaomi EV, specialized in lidar perception. I earned my MSc in Computer Science at University of California, San Diego, where I had the opportunity to work with [Professor Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/) from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

Prior to that, I worked as a computer vision engineer at Dianei Technologies for 3 years, where I focused in R&D of medical AI. I also spent half a year in 2019 at Hang Seng Bank China working as management trainee at the global market department.

I earned my Master of Finance degree at University of California, San Diego, where I was sponsored by a fully-funded fellowship provided by China Scholarship Council. I went to Renmin University of China in Beijing and got dual bachelors in business management and law.

I grew up in the beautiful city of Liuzhou, which is famous for its automobile industry and controversially popular cuisine named 螺蛳粉.
