## Activities
- RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection

  Classify brain hemorrhages in CT slices. Used Xception and EfficientNet-B2 as the backbone. Calibrated the network with a small MLP. Ranked 8% among 1,345 teams.

- SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification

  Identify melanoma in lesion images. Used an ensemble of 4 CNNs and anomaly detection models such as isolation forest and kNN. Reached an AUC of 0.9293 and ranked 25% among 3,314 teams.
