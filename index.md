## Biography
I am a computer vision engineer at Dianei Technologies, a medical start-up based in Shanghai. My focus lies in medical AI, specifically in medical imaging. Prior to that, I spent half a year at Hang Seng Bank China, where I worked as management trainee at the global market department.

I eared my Master of Finance degree at University of California, San Diego, where I was sponsored by a fully-funded fellowship provided by China Scholarship Council. I went to Renmin University of China in Beijing and got dual bachelor in business management and law.

I grew up in the beautiful city of Liuzhou, which is famous for its automobile industry ([五菱神车](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Wuling-electric-cars-in-China-are-cheap-and-are-these-cars-of-good-quality-and-not-easily-damaged)) and controversially popular cuisine ([螺蛳粉](https://baike.baidu.com/pic/%E8%9E%BA%E8%9B%B3%E7%B2%89/1455359/1/4610b912c8fcc3cec3fd2cd2730dc188d43f86948ab3?fr=lemma&ct=single#aid=0&pic=2fdda3cc7cd98d10d39f918b213fb80e7aec90c5)).

## Activities
- MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge: 
Rib Fracture Detection and Classification, Jun. 2020

  Helped host the [MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge](https://ribfrac.grand-challenge.org/). Collected a large-scale rib fracture CT dataset of 660 studies, named RibFrac. Wrote [the official evaluation code](https://github.com/M3DV/RibFrac-Challenge) for the challenge.

- RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection, Nov. 2019

  Classify brain hemorrhages in CT slices. Used Xception and EfficientNet-B2 as the backbone and calibrated the network with a small MLP. Ranked 8% among 1,345 teams.
