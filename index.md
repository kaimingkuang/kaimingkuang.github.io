## Activities
- SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, Aug. 2020

  Identify melanoma in lesion images. Used an ensemble of 4 CNNs and anomaly detection models such as isolation forest and kNN. Reached an AUC of 0.9293 and ranked 25% among 3,314 teams.

- MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge: 
Rib Fracture Detection and Classification, Jun. 2020

  Helped host the MICCAI 2020 RibFrac Challenge. Collected a large-scale rib fracture CT dataset of 660 studies. Wrote [the official evaluation code](https://github.com/M3DV/RibFrac-Challenge) for the challenge.

- COVID19 Global Forecasting, Apr. 2020

  Forecast daily COVID-19 spread in regions around world. Used a Transformer encoder to predict a time series of COVID confirmed cases and fatalities around the world. Reached a RMSLE of 0.77 and ranked 25% among 472 teams.

- RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection, Nov. 2019

  Classify brain hemorrhages in CT slices. Used Xception and EfficientNet-B2 as the backbone. Calibrated the network with a small MLP. Ranked 8% among 1,345 teams.
